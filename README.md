The blue used in the banners was selected as a 'Bostonian' color for a few reasons. Primarily, Boston has a history of being a 'revolutionary' town, and the blue was a symbol or the patriotic soldiers during the war. Additionally, one of Boston's official colors is continental blue, so using a similar shade in the headings demonstrates some of Boston's personality. The tea color in the background is used for a similar reason, as it is reminiscent of the Boston tea party, and can demonstrate 'aged' paper, giving the website some of Boston's more historic feel.

After creating the individual pages and finishing writing, buttons were implemented to allow basic movement around the cite, going to and from the home page for each of the sub pages.

After the cite was functional and displayed the necessary information, fitting images were added to the tourist attractions to display what a visitor may be looking for when in Boston.

The largest challenge when working on this project was time management. While the code itself was straightforward, figuring out the design and making sure to find the time to work on this project was difficult. Because of this, the project does not look like what I had initially visualized, which demonstrates the primary thing that can be fixed to make a better website in the future.
